## Bio

I am a bit of a generalist with experience spanning molecular ecology, to avian ecology, to plant sciences, to aquatic ecology. However, I could best be described as a community ecologist with an interest in computational ecology, community assembly, and the quantitative methods we use to detect patterns of association within ecological communities. In my spare time I am an unskilled but enthusiastic mountain biker, trout fisher person, and mushroom hunter. My happy places all involve the outdoors with back country canoe camping, swimming, and snowshoeing being some of the things I can't get enough of.
